## Bug #1: Non-Functional "Add Goal" Button

### Issue Details
- **Bug ID:** BUG-001
- **Component:** Goal Setting Page
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Status:** Open

### Current Behavior

- Button displays proper styling and hover effects
- Clicking the button opens a modal form for goal creation
- Form submission appears to process but goals are not persisted
- No error messages are displayed to the user
- Modal closes after submission, giving false impression of success

### Expected Behavior
- Button should open goal creation modal (✓ Working)
- Form should validate user input (✓ Working)
- Successful submission should save goal to database
- New goal should appear in the active goals list
- User should receive success confirmation
- Goal should persist across page refreshes and sessions

### Steps to Reproduce

2. Click "Add Goal" button in top-right corner
3. Fill out the goal creation form:
   - Title: "Test Goal"

7. Refresh page and verify goal persistence

### Root Cause Analysis

- Form submission logic may have async/await issues

### Impact on User Experience
